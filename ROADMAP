Here are listed all the ideas that people can have (bearing with GTG if possible).

- Support other formats : TAU, CLOG (and derivated) (maybe ideas here : http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/PAPERS/perftools-review2.pdf)

- Clean OTF code :D. Use dynamic allocation instead of static with #define.

- Do an error interface.

- Test with g++.

- Make tests.

- Add a rabbit logo.

- Add a higher level interface.

- Is GTG thread safe ?
