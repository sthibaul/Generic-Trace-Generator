README        : This file, presenting the project

-- Directories
*config*      : Contains examples of configuration to build the project
*exm*         : Contains examples of programm using the library
*inc*         : Contains files to include

-- Directories created
*bin*         : Contains the executables made from the examples

*lib*         : Contains the library generated
*mod*         : Contains the Fortran modules
*obj*         : Contains the objects generated


==============================================
===    Building from the SVN repository:    ==
==============================================

First, you need to generate the configure files by running autoreconf:

$ autoreconf -vfi

Then, simply run configure && make && make install


==============================================
===               Examples :                ==
==============================================

The examples show code using the library.
You can compile them with *make examples*.
Their execution enables the creation of traces :
cpaje  creates the cpaje.trace using the C API
cpaje2 creates the cpaje2.trace using the C API
cvite  creates the cvite_root.ept trace (with cvite_proc*.ept) using the C API

The traces can be viewed using the ViTE tool. This API is used by the eztrace that automatically generate traces for code, without modifying it manually.

If you encounter any problem, please contact the GTG developper
mailing list (gtg-devel@lists.gforge.inria.fr) so that we can fix the feature as soon as possible.
You can also give us some feedback to help us improve the API.
